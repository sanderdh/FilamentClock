Parts needed (besides PCB):


[brass wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000552604875.html) (I used 1.6mm thickness)

[filaments](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000478265055.html) (Get the 12V version, I used warm white, be sure to order extra as they are brittle and break)

[psu](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001276013818.html) (I got this one but any 12V psu will do, 3A  should be more than enough)
